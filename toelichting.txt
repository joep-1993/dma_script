Customer id: 3800751597

Input Excel ('c:/Users/JoepvanSchagen/Downloads/dma_script_ivor.xlsx') should be read. It has 2 sheets, which should be 2 different functions. One to include and one to exclude items. First the inclusion. 

Retrieve sheet 'toevoegen'. These are the column headers:
1. Shop name
2. Shop ID
3. cat_toevoegen
4. Diepste cat iD
5. custom label 1

For each line, a campaign (if available) should be retreived from customer 3800751597, with campaign name 'PLA/*cat_uitsluiten*_*custom label 1*.
Next, the ad group within the campaign should be retreived. Then, the listing tree within the ad group should be rebuild. The rebuild function can be based upon the function 'rebuild_tree_with_specific_item_ids' in 'example_functions.txt'. However, the modification of the listing tree should be that the value of 'Shop name' is TARGETED as custom label 3. 

If the inclusion is successfull, the value of that specific line in Excel column F (6th column) should be set to TRUE. If not successfull, set to FALSE.

Second, the exclusion function. Retrieve sheet 'uitsluiten'. These are the column headers:
1. Shop name
2. Shop ID
3. cat_uitsluiten
4. Diepste cat iD
5. custom label 1

For each line, a campaign (if available) should be retreived from customer 3800751597, with campaign name 'PLA/*cat_uitsluiten*_*custom label 1*.
Next, the ad group within the campaign should be retrieved. Then, the listing tree within the ad group should be rebuild. The rebuild function can be based upon the function 'rebuild_tree_with_label_and_item_ids' in 'example_functions.txt'. However, the modification of the listing tree should be that the value of 'Shop name' is EXCLUDED as custom label 3.

If the exclusion is successfull, the value of that specific line in Excel column F (6th column) should be set to TRUE. If not successfull, set to FALSE.
