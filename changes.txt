Input Excel ('c:/Users/JoepvanSchagen/Downloads/dma_script_ivor.xlsx') should be read. It has 2 sheets, which should be 2 different functions. One to include and one to exclude items. First the inclusion. 

Retrieve sheet 'toevoegen'. These are the column headers:
1. Shop name
2. Shop ID
3. maincat
4. maincat_id
5. custom label 1
6. budget

For each distinct combination of maincat and custom label 1 (for example "Auto's" + "a") a campaign should be created, which can be done by using the function "add_standard_shopping_campaign" in google_ads_helpers.py. The name of the campaign should be 'PLA/*Maincat* store_*custom label 1*' and the budget can be found in column F (6th column). Then, ad groups should be created for ALL Shop names (column A) with the specific maincat value in column C. Name of the ad groups should be setup like 'PLA/*Shop name*_*custom label 1*'. Then, a listing tree should be added to the ad group, targeting maincat_id as custom value 0, then subdividing and targeting Shop name as custom value 3. Excluding everything else. 
If the inclusion is successfull, the value of that specific line in Excel column G (7th column) should be set to TRUE. If not successfull, set to FALSE.

All helper functions can be found in google_ads_helpers.py.
